# Exploit-writing for OSWE

## Background

### What

This repository contains a list of useful snippets and tips that pertain to the writing of exploits in the OSWE labs and certification exam.

### Why

* While there are many write-ups, reviews, and notes on the certification, few resources specifically focus on the process of writing exploits.
* Writing the exploit script can be daunting, especially for those who are new to Python or have little experience interacting with web applications through code.
* Time spent on identifying vulnerabilities and documenting an exam report can fluctuate considerably, but the time allocated to developing the exploit script can be minimized and kept constant if done proficiently.
